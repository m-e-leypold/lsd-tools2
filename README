* About lsd-tools2

'lsd-tools2' is a collection of (supposedly useful) tools, scripts and
libraries.

At the moment this collection only serves my personal needs. I'm only
putting it online because 

  - I need the software at multiple sites 
  - there is nothing really secret in these scripts
  - I'm loath to duplicate the effort

Some of them are based on unusual ideas, that are, sadly, at the
moment practically undocumented. Others are incomplete, because a
larger idea has only been implmented up to the point where it was
needed momentarily.

Therefore these scripts are probably not fit for public consumption,
though you, dear reader, are of course welcome to pick whatever you
think you can use (as long as you stick to the terms of the [[LICENSE
(GPL 3)]]).

Please note the [[LICENSE (GPL 3)]].
