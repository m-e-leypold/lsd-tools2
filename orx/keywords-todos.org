* Keyword for open points and tasks
** Open TODO points

#+TODO: NOW(n)  | 
#+TODO: TODO(t) | DONE(d)
#+TODO: WAITING(w)  |
#+TODO: | CANCELLED(c)

The order of definition matters here: NOW should always be defined first. Then
org-do-promote (M-left) removes the keyword, which makes it usefule to prefix other
keywords with "NOW". This is admittedly only a hcak, but a useful one.

** Tickets

#+TODO: TICKET      | TICKET_CLOSED
#+TODO: BUG         | BUG_CLOSED

These are different from TASKs or TODOs. SEE ALSO: [[id:378f7d7c-df76-423e-8dbe-e2357309ffd5][NOTE <2013-12-19 Thu> TICKET and BUG
