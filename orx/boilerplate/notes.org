:BOILERPLATE:

This is the preliminary boilerplate for an orx notes store. See BOILERPLATE notes in
[[~/.orx/orx/boilerplate/workspace.org][boilerplate/workspace.org]] for some hints on the relationship between projects, workspaces
and process (there should also be a SOP note around somewhere, but probably unpublished).

See [[~/.orx/orx/boilerplate/tickets.org][boilerplate/tickets.org]] for the variables to be replaced. 

As of [2014-05-11 Sun] the difference between NOTES.org and ARCHIVE.org is not quite
clear. It is assumed that stuff in ARCHIVE org will not show up in agendas, while stuff in
NOTES.org will.

NOTES.org will contain DIARY entries as well as NOTEs. As of [2014-05-11 Sun] I assume
there will not be a [PROCESS-NAME]/DIARY.org.
